# De1-SoC-Verilog-Audio-Loopback

This is a simple project which is meant to generate hardware nessessary to loopback the ADC and DAC from the DE1-SoC audio codec. The project is meant to be a starting point for hardware audio DSP. The Audio codec is initialized for 16-bit audio, 48kHz left justified, but can be changed using QSYS. Also, the ADC and DAC are configured to be using the streaming interface rather than 
the memory-mapped interface so that you don't need to mess around with the Avalon bus. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, and then open the project in Quartus. You should be able to compile and program your DE1-SoC without needing to change anything. 

## Hardware Output

Here is what the whole system looks like.
