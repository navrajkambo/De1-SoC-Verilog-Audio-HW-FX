# De1-SoC-Verilog-Audio-Loopback

This is a simple project which is meant to generate hardware nessessary to loopback the ADC and DAC from the DE1-SoC audio codec. The project is meant to be a starting point for hardware audio DSP. The Audio codec is initialized for 16-bit audio, 44kHz left justified, but can be changed using QSYS. Also, the ADC and DAC are configured to be using the streaming interface rather than 
the memory-mapped interface so that you don't need to mess around with the Avalon bus. There is additional hardware created to save data to the on-board SDRAM using a hardware-only controller.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, and then open the project in Quartus. You should be able to compile and program your DE1-SoC without needing to change anything. 
## Features
1) Mute audio using switch 9 (`SW[9]`)
2) Add delayed audio effect using switch 1 (`SW[1]`)
3) Blink LED 0 (`LEDR[0]`) using switch 0 (`SW[0]`)
4) Save audio samples to 64MB SDRAM chip

## Hardware Output

Here is what the whole system looks like.
